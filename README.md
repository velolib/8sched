## Intro

8Sched is a simple web app that compiles my schoolâ€™s class schedules into an easy-to-use website. It lets students and teachers quickly check daily timetables, see subject and teacher assignments, and keep track of changes when the schedule is updated. The goal is to make accessing the school schedule straightforward and convenient for everyone.
