## Intro

8Sched is a simple web app that compiles my school’s class schedules into an easy-to-use website. It lets students and teachers quickly check daily timetables, view subject and teacher assignments, and stay updated when schedules change, making access to the school timetable fast and convenient for everyone.

8Sched reached feature completion after three main phases of development. The first phase focused on building the core experience of browsing schedules for students, bringing the idea to life with its initial design. The second phase introduced schedule browsing for teachers and a more modern interface. The third and final phase integrated the backend and completed all primary features, making 8Sched fully ready for use.

After the release of 1.0.0, the focus now sits in fixing bugs and adding new features when needed, ensuring the app remains smooth, reliable, and up to date with the school’s scheduling needs.
